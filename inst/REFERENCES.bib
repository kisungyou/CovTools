	abstract = {The covariance matrix plays an important role in statistical inference, yet modeling a covariance matrix is often a difficult task in practice due to its dimensionality and the non-negative definite constraint. In order to model a covariance matrix effectively, it is typically broken down into components based on modeling considerations or mathematical convenience. Decompositions that have received recent research attention include variance components, spectral decomposition, Cholesky decomposition, and matrix logarithm. In this paper we study a statistically motivated decomposition which appears to be relatively unexplored for the purpose of modeling. We model a covariance matrix in terms of its corresponding standard deviations and correlation matrix. We discuss two general modeling situations where this approach is useful: shrinkage estimation of regression coefficients, and a general location-scale model for both categorical and continuous variables. We present some simple choices for priors in terms of standard deviations and the correlation matrix, and describe a straightforward computational strategy for obtaining the posterior of the covariance matrix. We apply our method to real and simulated data sets in the context of shrinkage estimation.},

A now rich and complex body of work develops nearly or exactly minimax estimators for an array of interesting problems. Unfortunately, the results have rarely moved into practice, for a variety of reasons–among them being similarity to known methods, computational intractability and lack of spatial adaptivity. We discuss a arise from iterated mappings of the centre of the interval to which the map is applied. Particular attention is paid to the shape of an invariant distribution in the tails or in the neighbourhood of a pole of its density. A new technique is developed for this application. It enables us to combine `parametric' information, available from the structure of the map, with `nonparametric' information obtainable from numerical experiments.},

	abstract = {Variable selection is fundamental to high-dimensional statistical modeling, including nonparametric regression. Many approaches in use are stepwise selection procedures, which can be computationally expensive and ignore stochastic errors in the variable selection process. In this article, penalized likelihood approaches are proposed to handle these kinds of problems. The proposed methods select variables and estimate coefficients simultaneously. Hence they enable us to construct confidence intervals for estimated parameters. The proposed approaches are distinguished from others in that the penalty functions are symmetric, nonconcave on (0, ∞), and have singularities at the origin to produce sparse solutions. Furthermore, the penalty functions should be bounded by a constant to reduce bias and satisfy certain conditions to yield continuous solutions. A new algorithm is proposed for optimizing penalized likelihood functions. The proposed ideas are widely applicable. They are readily applied to a variety of parametric models such as generalized linear models and robust regression models. They can also be applied easily to nonparametric modeling by using wavelets and splines. Rates of convergence of the proposed penalized likelihood estimators are established. Furthermore, with proper choice of regularization parameters, we show that the proposed estimators perform as well as the oracle procedure in variable selection; namely, they work as well as if the correct submodel were known. Our simulation shows that the newly proposed methods compare favorably with other variable selection techniques. Furthermore, the standard error formulas are tested to be accurate enough for practical applications.},

This is a survey article that attempts to synthetize a broad variety of work on wavelets in statistics and includes some recent developments in nonparametric curve estimation that have been omitted from review articles and books on the subject. After a short introduction to wavelet theory, wavelets are treated in the familiar context of estimation of «smooth» functions. Both «linear» and «nonlinear» wavelet estimation methods are discussed and cross-validation methods for choosing the smoothing parameters are addressed. Finally, some areas of related research are mentioned, such as hypothesis testing, model selection, hazard rate estimation for censored data, and nonparametric change-point problems. The closing section formulates some promising research directions relating to wavelets in statistics.},

We propose a BIC-type criterion for the selection of the tuning parameter in the penalized likelihood methods. The connection between our methods and existing methods is illustrated.
